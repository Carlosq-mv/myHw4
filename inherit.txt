If you have multiple classes that are reusing the same code(methods & class members), just create a parent(base) class to hold all that code,
and the child classes will be able to use that code and expand upon it as needed.
It makes it possible to share functionality between classes and make code more reusable. 
It also helps to declutter all that repeating code and makes it easier to read.
