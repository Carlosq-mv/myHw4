1.  The only change that is happening is within the increment_int_a function so after the function call in the main method,
    a isn't incremented by 1.
2.  The change does happen after the increment_int_b function is called. The value tied with the key 32 is incremented by 1.
3.  The difference between these two is that dictionaries are mutable in python while integers are immutable. When passing in an
    immutable type in a function it creates a copy of it within that function so any changes will only live within the scope of that function.
    On the other hand, passing in a mutable type means you are working directly with it, so all changes made in the function are tied directly to that object.
